## Overview
This module provides a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Go. It's designed for educational purposes, to help users understand and apply fundamental DSA concepts in the Go programming language.

## Contents
- Linked Lists
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
- Trees
  - Binary Tree
  - Tree Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
- Sorting Algorithms
  - Quick Sort

```

## Usage
Import the required package from the module in your Go file. For example, to use the Binary Tree:
```go
import "dsa-module/trees"
```

## Examples
This module includes example files for each data structure and algorithm to demonstrate usage. To run an example, navigate to the `examples` directory and execute the Go file. For example:
```
go run examples/binarytree_example.go
```
